<h3>Spatial control of neural crest differentiation</h3>

The neural crest (NC) is a special embryonic cell population that migrates extensively throughout the early embryo to lots of different spatial locations. This means that NC cell state changes must be tightly coordinated with their position in space. I am investigating how key cell state decisions integrate both NC-intrinsic information (e.g., axial identity) with positional cues to control NC differentiation in space.
